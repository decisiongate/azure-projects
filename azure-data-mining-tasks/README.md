## Data mining tasks:
Primitives that Define a Data Mining Task:
- Task-relevant data
- Type of knowledge to be mined
- Background knowledge
- Pattern interestingness measurements
- Visualization/presentation of discovered patterns

Types of Knowledge to Be Mined:
- Characterization
- Discrimination
- Association
- Classification/prediction
- Clustering
- Outlier analysis
- Other data mining tasks

Measurements of Pattern Interestingness:
- Simplicity:
e.g., (association) rule length, (decision) tree size
- Certainty:
e.g., confidence, P(A|B) = #(A and B)/ #(B), classification
reliability or accuracy, certainty factor, rule strength, rule quality, discriminating weight, etc.
- Utility:
potential usefulness, e.g., support (association), noise threshold (description)
- Novelty:
not previously known, surprising (used to remove redundant rules)
